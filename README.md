# About üìã

`clipse` is a configurable, TUI-based clipboard manager application written in Go with minimal dependency. Though the app is optimized for a Linux OS using a dedicated window manager, `clipse` can also be used on any Unix-based system. Simply install the package and bind the open command to get your desired clipboard behavior. Further instructions for setting this up can be found below.

### Dependency info and libraries used

__[atotto/clipboard](https://github.com/atotto/clipboard)__

This requires a system clipboard. I would recommend using `wl-clipboard` (Wayland) or `xclip` (X11/macOs) to get the best results. You can also use `xsel` and `termux-clipboard`, but these will not allow you to copy images.

__[BubbleTea](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)__

Does not require any additional dependency, but may require you to use a terminal environment that's compatible with [termenv](https://github.com/muesli/termenv).

### Customization üß∞

A customizable TUI allows you to easily match your system's theme. The app is based on your terminal's theme by default but is editable from a `custom_theme.json` file that gets created when the program is run for the first time. See the [library](https://github.com/savedra1/clipse/blob/main/resources/library.md) for some example themes to give you inspiration.

An example `custom_theme.json` file:

```json
{
 "UseCustom":          true,
 "TitleFore":          "#ffffff",
 "TitleBack":          "#6F4CBC",
 "TitleInfo":          "#3498db",
 "NormalTitle":        "#ffffff",
 "DimmedTitle":        "#808080",
 "SelectedTitle":      "#FF69B4",
 "NormalDesc":         "#808080",
 "DimmedDesc":         "#808080",
 "SelectedDesc":       "#FF69B4",
 "StatusMsg":          "#2ecc71",
 "PinIndicatorColor":  "#FFD700",
 "SelectedBorder":     "#3498db",
 "SelectedDescBorder": "#3498db",
 "FilteredMatch":      "#ffffff",
 "FilterPrompt":       "#2ecc71",
 "FilterInfo":         "#3498db",
 "FilterText":         "#ffffff",
 "FilterCursor":       "#FFD700",
 "HelpKey":            "#999999",
 "HelpDesc":           "#808080",
 "PageActiveDot":      "#3498db",
 "PageInactiveDot":    "#808080",
 "DividerDot":         "#3498db",
 "PreviewedText":      "#ffffff",
 "PreviewBorder":      "#3498db",
}
```

You can also easily specify source config like custom paths and max history limit in the apps `config.json` file. For more information see [Configuration](#configuration) section.  

### Versatility üåê

The `clipse` binary, installable from the repository, can run on pretty much any Unix-based OS, though currently optimized for Linux. Being terminal-based also allows for easy integration with a window manager and configuration of how the TUI behaves. For example, binding a floating window to the `clipse` command as shown at the top of the page using [Hyprland window manager](https://hyprland.org/) on __NixOs__.

__Note that working with image files will require one of the following dependencies to be installed on your system__:

- Linux (X11) & macOS: [xclip](https://github.com/astrand/xclip)
- Linux (Wayland): [wl-clipboard](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard)

# Setup & installation üèóÔ∏è

See below for instructions on getting clipse installed and configured effectively.

## Installation

### Installing on NixOs

Due to how irregularly the stable branch of Nixpkgs is updated, you may find the unstable package is more up to date. The Nix package for `clipse` can be found [here](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=24.05&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=clipse)

__Direct install__

```nix
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.clipse # OS == NixOs
nix-env -f channel:nixpkgs -iA clipse # OS != NixOs
```

__Nix shell__

```nix
nix shell -p clipse
```

__System package__

```nix
environment.systemPackages = [
    pkgs.clipse
  ];
```

If building `clipse` from the unstable branch as a system package, I would suggest referencing [this article](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/installing-only-a-single-package-from-unstable/5598) for best practice. The derivation can also be built from source using the following:

```nix
{ lib
, buildGoModule
, fetchFromGitHub
}:

buildGoModule rec {
  pname = "clipse";
  version = "1.1.0";

  src = fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "savedra1";
    repo = "clipse";
    rev = "v${version}";
    hash = "sha256-Kpe/LiAreZXRqh6BHvUIn0GcHloKo3A0WOdlRF2ygdc=";
  };

  vendorHash = "sha256-Hdr9NRqHJxpfrV2G1KuHGg3T+cPLKhZXEW02f1ptgsw=";

  meta = {
    description = "Useful clipboard manager TUI for Unix";
    homepage = "https://github.com/savedra1/clipse";
    license = lib.licenses.mit;
    mainProgram = "clipse";
    maintainers = [ lib.maintainers.savedra1 ];
  };
}
```

## Set up

As mentioned earlier, to get the most out of `clipse`, it's recommended to bind the two primary key commands to your system's config. The first key command is to open the clipboard history TUI:

```shell
clipse
```

The second command doesn't need to be bound to a key combination, but rather to the system boot to run the background listener on start-up:

```shell
clipse -listen  
```

The above command creates a `nohup` process of `clipse --listen-shell`, which if called on its own will start a listener in your current terminal session instead. If `nohup` is not supported on your system, you can use your preferred method of running `clipse --listen-shell` in the background instead.

__Note: The following examples are based on bash/zsh shell environments. If you use something else like `foot` or `fish`, you may need to construct the command differently, referencing the relevant documentation.__

### Hyprland

Add the following lines to your Hyprland config file:

```shell

exec-once = clipse -listen # run listener on startup

windowrulev2 = float,class:(clipse) # ensure you have a floating window class set if you want this behavior
windowrulev2 = size 622 652,class:(clipse) # set the size of the window as necessary

bind = SUPER, V, exec,  <terminal name> --class clipse -e 'clipse' 

# Example: bind = SUPER, V, exec, alacritty --class clipse -e 'clipse'
```

[Hyprland reference](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Window-Rules/)

### i3

Add the following commands to your `~/.config/i3/config` file:

```shell
exec --no-startup-id clipse -listen                                                           # run listener on startup
bindsym $mod+V exec --no-startup-id urxvt -e "$SHELL" -c "i3-msg 'floating enable' && clipse" # Bind floating shell with TUI selection to something nice 
```

[i3 reference](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/i3)

### Sway

Add the following config to your `~/.config/sway/config` file:

```shell
exec clipse -listen                                                                        # run the background listener on startup

for_window [app_id="clipse"] floating enable, move position center, resize set 80ppt 80ppt # style window to look nice

bindsym $mod+V exec <terminal name> --class clipse -e clipse                               # bind floating shell with clipse TUI

# Example: bindsym $mod+V exec alacritty --class clipse -e clipse
```

[Sway reference](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Sway#Floating_windows)

### MacOs

The native terminal on MacOs will not close once the `clipse` program completes, even when using the `-fc` argument. You will therefore need to use a different terminal environment like [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) to achieve the "close on selection" effect. The bindings used to open the TUI will then need to be defined in your settings/window manager.

### Other

Every system/window manager is different and hard to determine exactly how to achieve the more ‚ÄòGUI-like‚Äô behavior. If using something not mentioned above, just refer to your systems documentation to find how to:

- Run the `clipse -listen` / `clipse --listen-shell` command on startup
- Bind the `clipse` command to a key that opens a terminal session (ideally in a window)

If you're not calling `clipse` with a command like `exec <terminal name> -e sh -c` and want to force the terminal window to close on selection of an item, use the `-fc` arg to pass in the `$PPID` variable so the program can force kill the shell session. EG `clipse -fc $PPID`. _Note that the $PPID variable is not available in every terminal environment, like fish terminal where you'd need to use $fish_pid instead._

## Configuration

The configuration capabilities of `clipse` will change as `clipse` evolves and grows. Currently, clipse supports the following configuration:

- Setting custom paths for:
  - The clipboard history file
  - The clipboard binaries directory (copied images and other binary data is stored in here)
  - The debug log file
  - The clipboard UI theme file
- Setting a custom max history limit
- Automatically deleting non-pinned entries older than specified
- Custom themes
- If duplicates are allowed
- Setting custom key bindings
- Image display mode

`clipse` looks for a base config file in `$CONFIG_DIR/clipse/config.json` _(`$CONFIG_DIR` being `$XDG_DATA_HOME` or `$HOME/.config`)_, and creates a default file if it does not find anything. The default config looks like this:

```json
{
    "historyFile": "clipboard_history.json",
    "maxHistory": 100,
    "allowDuplicates": false,
    "themeFile": "custom_theme.json",
    "tempDir": "tmp_files",
    "logFile": "clipse.log",
    "keyBindings": {
        "choose": "enter",
        "clearSelected": "S",
        "down": "down",
        "end": "end",
        "filter": "/",
        "home": "home",
        "more": "?",
        "nextPage": "right",
        "prevPage": "left",
        "preview": "t",
        "quit": "q",
        "remove": "x",
        "selectDown": "ctrl+down",
        "selectSingle": "s",
        "selectUp": "ctrl+up",
        "togglePin": "p",
        "togglePinned": "tab",
        "up": "up",
        "yankFilter": "ctrl+s"
     },
    "imageDisplay": {
        "type": "basic",
        "scaleX": 9,
        "scaleY": 9,
        "heightCut": 2
     }
}
```

Note that all the paths provided (the theme, `historyFile`, and `tempDir`) are all relative paths. They are relative to the location of the config file that holds them. Thus, a file `config.json` at location `$HOME/.config/clipse/config.json` will have all relative paths defined in it relative to its directory of `$HOME/.config/clipse`.

Absolute paths starting with `/`, paths relative to the user home dir using `~`, or any environment variables like `$HOME` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` are also valid paths that can be used in this file instead.

Currently these are the supported options for `imageDisplay.type`:
 - `basic` 
 - `kitty` 
 - `sixel` 
 
 The `scaleX` and `scaleY` options are the scaling factors for the images. Depending on the situation, you need to find suitable numbers to ensure the images are displayed correctly and completely. You can make adjustments based on [this implementation](https://github.com/savedra1/clipse/pull/138#issue-2530565414).

## All commands üíª

`clipse` is more than just a TUI. It also offers a number of CLI commands for managing clipboard content directly from the terminal.

```shell
# Operational commands 

clipse -a <arg>       # Adds <arg> directly to the clipboard history without copying to system clipboard (string

clipse -a             # Adds any standard input directly to the clipboard history without copying to the system clipboard.

                      # For example: echo "some data" | clipse -a

clipse -c <arg>       # Copy the <arg> to the system clipboard (string). This also adds to clipboard history if currently listening. 

clipse -c             # Copies any standard input directly to the system clipboard.

                      # For example: echo "some data" | clipse -c

clipse -p             # Prints the current clipboard content to the console. 

                      # Example: clipse -p > file.txt

# TUI management commands

clipse                # Open Clipboard TUI in persistent/debug mode

clipse -fc $PPID      # Open Clipboard TUI in 'force kill' mode 

clipse -listen        # Run a background listener process

clipse --listen-shell # Run a listener process in the current terminal (useful for debugging)

clipse -help          # Display menu option

clipse -v             # Get version

clipse -clear         # Wipe all clipboard history except for pinned items

clipse -clear-images  # Wipe all images from the history 

clipse -clear-text    # Wipe all text items from the clipboard history

clipse -clear-all     # Wipe entire clipboard history

clipse keep           # Keep the TUI open after selecting an item to copy (useful for debugging)

clipse -kill          # Kill any existing background processes
```

You can also view the full list of TUI key commands by hitting the `?` key when the `clipse` UI is open.

## How it works ü§î

When the app is run for the first time it creates a `/home/$USER/.config/clipse` dir containing `config.json`, `clipboard_history.json`, `custom_theme.json` and a dir called `tmp_files` for storing image data. After the `clipse -listen` command is executed, a background process will be watching for clipboard activity and adding any changes to the `clipboard_history.json` file, unless a different path is specified in `config.json`.

The TUI that displays the clipboard history with the defined theme should then be called with the `clipse` command. Operations within the TUI are defined with the [BubbleTea](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) framework, allowing for efficient concurrency and a smooth UX. `delete` operations will remove the selected item from the TUI view and the storage file, `select` operations will copy the item to the systems clipboard and exit the program.

The maximum item storage limit defaults at __100__ but can be customized to anything you like in the `config.json` file.

## FAQ

__Clipse crashes when I enter certain characters into the search bar__

See issue #148. This is caused by the fuzzy find algo _(within the BubbleTea TUI framework code)_ crashing when it encounters non-compatible characters in the history file, such as an irregular image binary pattern or a rare non-ascii text character. The fix is to to remove the clipboard entry that contains the problematic character. I would recommend pinning any items you do not want to lose and running `clipse -clear`.  


__My terminal window does not close on selection, even when using `clipse -fc $PPID`__

Some terminal environments reference system variables differently. For example, the fish terminal will need to use `$fish_pid` instead. To debug this error you can run `echo $PPID` to see what gets returned. To get the "close on selection" effect for macOs, you will need to install a different terminal environment like `Alacritty`._
<br>

__Is there risk of multiple parallel processes running?__

_No. The `clipse` command kills any existing TUI processes before opening up and the `clipse -listen`  command kills any existing background listeners before starting a new one._
<br>

__High CPU usage?__

When an image file has an irregular binary data pattern it can cause a lot of strain on the program when `clipse` reads its history file (even when the TUI is not open). If this happens, you will need to remove the image file from the TUI or by using `clipse -clear-images`. See issue #33 for an example.
<br>

__My copied entries are not recorded when starting the clipse listener on boot with a systemd service__

There may be a few ways around this but the workaround discovered in issue #41 was to use a `.desktop` file, stored in `~/.config/autostart/`. Eg:

  ```shell
  [Desktop Entry]
  Name=clipse
  Comment=Clipse event listener autostart.
  Exec=/home/usrname/Applications/bin/clipse/clipse_1.1.0_linux_amd64/clipse --listen %f
  Terminal=false
  Type=Application
  ```

<br>

__Copying images from a browser does not work correctly__  

Depending on the clipboard utility you are using (`wl-clipboard`/`xclip` etc) the data sent to the system clipboard is read differently when copying from browser locations.
<br>
If using `wayland`, copying images from your browser should now work from most sites if using `v1.0.4` or later. This may copy the binary data as well as the metadata sting as a separate entry. Some sites/browsers may add the browser image data to the stdin in a way that `wl-clipboard` does not recognize.
<br>
If using `x11`, `MacOs` or other and copying browser images does not work, feel free to raise and issue (or a PR) detailing which sites/browser engines this does not work with for you.
  
<br>
